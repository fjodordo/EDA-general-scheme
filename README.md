# 📊 EDA General Scheme (Exploratory Data Analysis)

**A flexible framework for exploratory data analysis**, designed to be adaptable to various data types and subject areas.  
This project serves as a reusable EDA "skeleton" that will grow and evolve as my technical skills improve.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to build a general-purpose toolkit for:

- Quick **data inspection, cleaning**, and **preprocessing**;
- Automating **visualization** and **statistical analysis**;
- Discovering patterns and generating hypotheses across different datasets.

It is both a learning platform and a base for production-quality EDA workflows.

## 🛠️ Components

- 🧱 Modular tools: planned to be implemented as Python classes (OOP), such as:
  - `DataQualityChecker`
  - `OutlierHandler`
  - `CorrelationAnalyzer`
  - `DataVisualizer`
- 🧪 Notebook-based experiments and narrative analysis

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This project is under active development and will grow iteratively.  
It’s part of my journey toward building better data understanding, research tools, and ML-ready pipelines.
